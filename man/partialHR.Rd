\usage{
partialHR(om)
}
\arguments{
\item{om}{An operating model object (typically an \code{FLombf} or other
object for which \code{fisheries(om)} and \code{biol(om)} are defined).}
}
\value{
A list of FLQuant-like objects (one per fishery) containing the
partial harvest rate with units set to 'hr'.
}
\description{
Compute partial harvest-rate estimates for each fishery in a FLombf operating
model objecta. For each fishery the function calculates the ratio:
catch (by fishery) / sum(S_f * N * W)
where S_f is the fishery selectivity (catch.sel), N is numbers-at-age and
W are weights at age in the population.
The resulting object(s) are given units 'hr'.
}
\details{
Compute partial harvest rates by fishery

The function sums catches across sexes/other dimensions using
\code{unitSums} and similarly aggregates the product of numbers, weights
and selection pattern. The returned values are per-iteration and per-unit
as produced by the underlying FL* methods.
